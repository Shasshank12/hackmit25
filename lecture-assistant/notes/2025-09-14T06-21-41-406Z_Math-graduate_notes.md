## Summary

This transcript appears to capture a technical debugging session rather than a formal mathematics lecture on ordinary differential equations. The participants are troubleshooting display issues with definitions and text truncation in what seems to be an educational software application, while planning to work on a flashcards pipeline for their demo.

## Key Points

- Initial mention of ordinary differential equations as the intended topic
- Discussion of debugging display issues with text overflow and truncation
- Problems with longer definitions not displaying properly on screen
- Introduction of ellipses ("wedges") and community nodes as display elements
- Issues with CSS/display formatting requiring a switch back to "text balls"
- Decision to pause current debugging work to focus on flashcards pipeline
- Plan to use shorter definitions for demo purposes
- Need to restore to a previously working version of the software

## Detailed Notes

## Technical Context
**Software Development Session**: This transcript documents a debugging session for what appears to be an educational technology application rather than a traditional mathematics lecture.

## Initial Topic Introduction
**Ordinary Differential Equations**: 
- Briefly mentioned as the intended subject matter
- No mathematical content actually covered due to technical issues

## Technical Issues Identified

### Display Problems
**Text Overflow and Truncation**:
- Longer definitions causing display issues
- Text not fitting properly within designated screen areas
- Need to handle variable-length content appropriately

**Visual Elements**:
- "Wedges" - symbols that appear when definitions exceed display limits
- "Community nodes" - additional display elements in the interface
- Ellipses being added programmatically to truncated text

### Code-Related Issues
**CSS/Display Framework Problems**:
- Current display method causing text truncation
- Need to revert to "text balls" display method
- Previous working version needs to be restored

## Development Strategy

### Immediate Solutions
**Short-term Workarounds**:
- Use words with shorter definitions for demo purposes
- Restore to previously working software version
- Pause current debugging efforts

### Long-term Development Goals
**Flashcards Pipeline**:
- Identified as priority development task
- Expected to require significant time investment
- Critical for demo functionality

## Project Management Decisions
**Resource Allocation**:
- Decision to halt current debugging work
- Focus shift to flashcards feature development
- Time management considerations for demo preparation

**Quality Assurance**:
- Recognition of need to maintain working version
- Emphasis on demo readiness over feature completeness

Note: This transcript contains minimal mathematical content despite being labeled as a graduate-level mathematics lecture on ordinary differential equations. The actual content focuses entirely on software development and debugging processes.
