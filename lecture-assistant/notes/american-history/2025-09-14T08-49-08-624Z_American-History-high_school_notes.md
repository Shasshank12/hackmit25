## Constitutional Framework

### Three Branches of Government
The Constitution established a system of separation of powers through three distinct branches:

#### Legislative Branch

  - **Senate**: Upper house of Congress
  - **House of Representatives**: Lower house of Congress
- **Significance**: Represents the will of the people through elected representatives

### Important Constitutional Concepts

## Government Structure Details

- **Senate**: Equal representation for all states (2 senators per state)
- **House of Representatives**: Representation based on state population
- **Function**: Both houses must work together to create and pass federal legislation

### Constitutional Principles
- **Separation of Powers**: Government power divided among three branches to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful
- **Checks and Balances**: Each branch has ways to limit the power of the other branches
- **Federalism**: Power shared between federal and state governments

This lecture provides a foundational understanding of how America transitioned from British colonies to an independent nation with a structured government based on democratic principles and constitutional law.
