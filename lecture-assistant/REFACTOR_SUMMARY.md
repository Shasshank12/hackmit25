# Lecture Assistant Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The lecture assistant has been refactored to follow the architectural patterns from Merge-gcal, creating a more maintainable, scalable, and robust codebase.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Agent-Based Architecture**

- **LectureProcessor**: Coordinates transcript analysis and decides when to extract key terms
- **KeyTermDetector**: Detects academic terms using pattern matching and confidence scoring
- **DefinitionProvider**: Provides definitions for detected key terms with fallback mechanisms
- **CaptionManager**: Manages display modes and handles UI state transitions

### 2. **Centralized Configuration**

- `config.ts`: Centralized configuration with environment variables and agent settings
- Type-safe settings with proper defaults
- Runtime configuration changes supported

### 3. **Type Safety & Structure**

- `types.ts`: Comprehensive type definitions for all data structures
- Enums for actions, agent types, and display modes
- Strong typing throughout the codebase

### 4. **Event-Driven Architecture**

- **LectureResponseHandler**: Main coordinator similar to Merge-gcal's MergeResponseHandler
- Real-time transcription processing with utterance buffering
- Proper event cleanup and session management

### 5. **Modular Organization**

```
src/
├── agents/           # Individual agent implementations
├── handlers/         # Main response coordination
├── utils/           # Utility functions
├── config.ts        # Configuration management
├── types.ts         # Type definitions
└── index.ts         # Main application server
```

## New Features

### **Intelligent Key Term Detection**

- Pattern-based detection with confidence scoring
- Category classification (AI/ML, Programming, Mathematics, Academic)
- Duplicate detection using similarity matching
- Context-aware extraction

### **Smart Display Management**

- Non-interrupting display logic
- Head tilt gesture recognition for key terms view
- Automatic display timeouts and cleanup
- Multiple display modes (captions, key terms, menu)

### **Enhanced Settings System**

- Real-time settings changes
- Frequency-based filtering (off/standard/high)
- Feature toggles (auto definitions, live captions)
- Persistent user preferences

### **Robust Error Handling**

- Comprehensive logging using session.logger
- Graceful fallbacks for display failures
- Proper cleanup on session disconnect
- Error recovery mechanisms

## Architecture Benefits

### **From Merge-gcal Patterns:**

1. **Response Handler Pattern**: Centralized coordination of all agents
2. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has a specific, well-defined responsibility
3. **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript interfaces prevent runtime errors
4. **Configuration Management**: Centralized, type-safe configuration
5. **Event-Driven Processing**: Real-time response to transcription events
6. **Session Management**: Proper lifecycle management and cleanup

### **Lecture Assistant Specific:**

1. **Academic Focus**: Specialized for educational content detection
2. **Gesture Integration**: Head tilt recognition for hands-free interaction
3. **Learning Context**: Maintains conversation history for better term detection
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works with basic features, enhanced with advanced ones

## Usage

The refactored system maintains the same external interface but provides:

- More reliable key term detection
- Better display management
- Configurable behavior
- Enhanced error handling
- Improved performance

## Migration Notes

- Old `LectureManager` and `KeyTermExtractor` classes are replaced by the new agent system
- Settings are now managed through the Mentra SDK settings system
- Display logic is centralized in `CaptionManager`
- All event handling is consolidated in the main app class

## Future Enhancements

The new architecture makes it easy to add:

- Additional agent types (e.g., QuizGenerator, NotesTaker)
- External API integrations (Wikipedia, academic databases)
- Machine learning models for better term detection
- Advanced gesture recognition
- Multi-language support
